# Problem 1

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")
```

\`This dataset collects 1384617 observations, each row is a single
product that customer buy using instacart. There are 15 variables. The
key variable includes “add\_to\_cart\_order” representing the order that
customer adds the product to the cart; “reordered” representing if the
customer has ordered it before; “order\_dow” represenging the day of the
week that costomer orders; and “aisle” representing the name of the
aisle.

## How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items ordered from?

``` r
aisle_count = 
  instacart %>% 
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  summarise(n_obs = n())
head(aisle_count)
```

    ## # A tibble: 6 x 2
    ##   aisle                  n_obs
    ##   <chr>                  <int>
    ## 1 air fresheners candles  1067
    ## 2 asian foods             7007
    ## 3 baby accessories         306
    ## 4 baby bath body care      328
    ## 5 baby food formula      13198
    ## 6 bakery desserts         1501

Here, we got the counts of each aisle, there are totally 134 different
kinds of aisles. To get the most popular one, we could do following:

``` r
aisle_count %>% 
  filter(n_obs == max(n_obs))
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 2
    ##   aisle             n_obs
    ##   <chr>             <int>
    ## 1 fresh vegetables 150609

Therefore, we got that the most popular one is “fresh vegetables”, and
it has been ordered 150609 times.

## Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle, limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered. Arrange aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.

First only get the aisles more than 10000, and arrange them from
according to the number of items:

``` r
aisle_count = 
  aisle_count %>% 
  filter(n_obs >= 10000) %>% 
  mutate(aisle = forcats::fct_reorder(aisle, n_obs))
```

Then get the scatter plot showing the numbers of items ordered in each
aisle:

``` r
aisle_count_plot = 
  aisle_count %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = n_obs, y = aisle, color = aisle)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(
    title = "number of aisle scatter plot",
    x = "Number of items ordered",
    y = "Aisle name",
    caption = "Data from the p8105.dataset package, only shows items greater than or equal to 10000"
  )
aisle_count_plot
```

## Make a table showing the three most popular items in each of the aisles “baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables fruits”. Include the number of times each item is ordered in your table.

``` r
selected_aisle_table = 
  instacart %>% 
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>% 
  group_by(aisle, product_name) %>% 
    summarise(n_obs = n()) %>% 
  mutate(product_ranking = min_rank(desc(n_obs))) %>% 
  filter(product_ranking %in% c(1, 2, 3)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n_obs)) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'aisle'. You can override using the `.groups` argument.

``` r
selected_aisle_table
```

| aisle                      | product\_name                                 | n\_obs | product\_ranking |

## Make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week; format this table for human readers (i.e. produce a 2 x 7 table).

``` r
mean_hour_table = 
  instacart %>% 
  select(product_name, order_dow, order_hour_of_day) %>% 
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) %>% 
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>% 
  summarise(mean_order_hour_of_day = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = product_name,
              values_from = mean_order_hour_of_day) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'product_name'. You can override using the `.groups` argument.

``` r
mean_hour_table
```

| order\_dow | Coffee Ice Cream | Pink Lady Apples |
|-----------:|-----------------:|-----------------:|
|          0 |         13.77419 |         13.44118 |
|          1 |         14.31579 |         11.36000 |
|          2 |         15.38095 |         11.70213 |
|          3 |         15.31818 |         14.25000 |
|          4 |         15.21739 |         11.55172 |
|          5 |         12.26316 |         12.78431 |

# Problem 2

``` r
data("brfss_smart2010")
```

Firstly clean and tidy the data.

``` r
brfss_smart2010 = 
  brfss_smart2010 %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(topic == "Overall Health",
         response %in% c("Excellent", "Very good", "Good", "Fair", "Poor")) %>% 
  mutate(response = forcats::fct_relevel(response, c("Poor", "Fair", "Good", "Very good", "Excellent")))
```

## In 2002, which states were observed at 7 or more locations? What about in 2010?

For 2002:

``` r
brfss_smart2010 %>% 
  filter(year == 2002) %>% 
  group_by(locationabbr, locationdesc) %>% 
  summarise(n_obs = n()) %>% 
  group_by(locationabbr) %>% 
  summarise(num_locations = n()) %>% 
  filter(num_locations >= 7) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'locationabbr'. You can override using the `.groups` argument.

| locationabbr | num\_locations |
|:-------------|---------------:|
| CT           |              7 |
| FL           |              7 |
| MA           |              8 |
| NC           |              7 |
| NJ           |              8 |
| PA           |             10 |

As a result, the states that were observed at 7 or more locations in
2002 are: CT, FL, MA, NC, NJ, PA.

For 2010:

``` r
brfss_smart2010 %>% 
  filter(year == 2010) %>% 
  group_by(locationabbr, locationdesc) %>% 
  summarise(n_obs = n()) %>% 
  group_by(locationabbr) %>% 
  summarise(num_locations = n()) %>% 
  filter(num_locations >= 7) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'locationabbr'. You can override using the `.groups` argument.

| locationabbr | num\_locations |
|:-------------|---------------:|
| CA           |             12 |
| CO           |              7 |
| FL           |             41 |
| MA           |              9 |
| MD           |             12 |
| NC           |             12 |
| NE           |             10 |
| NJ           |             19 |
| NY           |              9 |
| OH           |              8 |
| PA           |              7 |
| SC           |              7 |
| TX           |             16 |
| WA           |             10 |

As a result, the states that were observed at 7 or more locations in
2010 are: CA, CO, FL, MA, MD, NC, NE, NJ, NY, OH, PA, SC, TX, WA.
